# Canary

We want to help build a world where all workers feel and are safe; a world where all sexual harassment is reported and the number of incidents is in decline, where harmful cultural norms are addressed through constructive conversation and improved behavior, where larger incidents lead to justice. In our vision of the world, toxic masculinity is in decline, and people are empowered to learn from each other and grow together. At Canary, we believe that such a world is achievable. Letâ€™s work together to be better. 

We're a team in the [Zinc VC](https://www.zinc.vc/) incubator.
